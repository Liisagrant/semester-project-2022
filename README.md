# Sniper - An Online Auction Site 💰

This is my semester exam project for the year 2022 as a frontend developer at Noroff School of Technology. 🎓

This online auction site allows users to add items to be bid on and bid on items put up for auction by other users. 💻

New users are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can earn more credits by selling items and use credits to bid on items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids. 💰

The page is built using Vite, along with:

- HTML 📜
- CSS 🎨
- Tailwind 🌪
- Vanilla JavaScript 🍦

## How to Run the Project 🏃‍♂️

This project is built using Vite, so there is no need to install Vite in order to run it. To run the project, simply clone or fork this repository. Then, in the project directory, run the following commands:

```
npm run build
```
and
```
npm run dev
```


After running these commands, the project will be built and served locally. 💻

Note that you will need an internet connection in order to run this project, as it relies on vite's dev server. 📡

Enjoy! 😊
