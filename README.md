# Sniper - An Online Auction Site 💰

This is my semester exam project for the year 2022 as a frontend developer at Noroff School of Technology. 🎓

This online auction site allows users to add items to be bid on and bid on items put up for auction by other users. 💻

New users are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can earn more credits by selling items and use credits to bid on items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids. 💰

The page is built using Vite, along with:

- HTML 📜
- CSS 🎨
- Tailwind 🌪
- Vanilla JavaScript 🍦

## How to Run the Project 🏃‍♂️

This project is built using Vite. To run the project, simply clone or fork this repository. Then, in your project terminal, run the following commands:

|Commands           | What the command does                      |
